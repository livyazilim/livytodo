# Livytodo is more than just a to-do list

Livytodo is a project launched to add a different dimension to to-do list applications. Livytodo focuses on creating professional lists rather than personalized lists. You can plan your daily activities and update their realization status. You can record repetitive activities and special days and follow them effortlessly. You can view the activities of your entire team, including yourself, on calendars and charts.

Livytodo is a server-client architecture application that works independently of the operating system. Although it has a database dependency, the distributable version comes with an SQLite database.

Our application, which has its own application framework, reaches the end user via HTML interface on the client side. Our application, whose business layer coding was developed with Python, simplifies the design of database applications with its additional functionalities.
